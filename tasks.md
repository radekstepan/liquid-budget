# Tasks

How to work through the task list below. Follow the steps in order, every run.

## 1. Read the preamble

Before touching any task, read all of this for context:

- `AGENTS.md` — commands, code map, conventions, gotchas (source of truth for workflow).
- `README.md` — product context.
- `.planning/codebase/*.md` — architecture, conventions, testing, integrations.
- `git status` / `git log --oneline -5` — current state and recent work.

Do not skip this even if you have read it before — it may have changed (see step 5).

## 2. Work through tasks in series with subagents

- Take tasks from the list below **in order, one at a time**. Finish a task fully before starting the next.
- Run each task in a **fresh subagent** with the task text plus the preamble files above as context.
- A task is done only when its acceptance criteria hold **and** step 3 passes.
- If a task is blocked, stop the series, note the blocker on the task, and report back. Do not skip ahead.

## 3. Tests must pass

After each task, before committing:

- `yarn test` — full suite must pass.
- `yarn typecheck` — must pass.
- `yarn e2e` — required if the task touched `apps/web`, `packages/ui`, or e2e specs (always via root `yarn e2e` so the port is cleaned; see `AGENTS.md` gotchas).

Never move to the next task with red tests. Fix the code, not the test — unless the test itself is wrong, in which case say so explicitly.

## 4. Commit each task with a changeset

One commit per task, pairing the code with a changeset file that carries the story details:

1. Add `.changeset/<task-id>-<short-slug>.md`:

   ```md
   ---
   "@ynab/web": patch
   "@ynab/logic": patch
   ---

   ## <Task title> (<task-id>)

   <Story: what changed from the user's perspective and why.>
   <Notes: behavior changes, migration steps, follow-ups.>
   ```

   List only the workspaces actually changed; use `minor` for new features, `patch` otherwise.

2. Commit code + changeset together: `git commit -am "<task-id>: <title>"`.
3. Never commit `budget.db*`, `*.y4backup`, `import.csv`, or `snapshots/*.json` (see `yarn check:artifacts`).

## 5. Write major learnings back to markdown

If a task taught you something durable (a gotcha, a convention, an architectural fact, a corrected assumption), update the docs in the same commit:

- Repo workflow / commands / gotchas → `AGENTS.md`.
- Architecture / conventions / testing / integrations → the matching `.planning/codebase/*.md`.
- User-visible behavior → `README.md`.

Small, task-local details stay in the changeset, not the docs.

## Task list (in order)

Spending by Category - Sankey has these issues:
- onhover category/merchant is slightly bigger than the sankey leading into it, like a 1px border or something
- the sankey is too fucking opaque, make it almost as solid as onhover!!!
- you need to calculate flow through. If salary -> investment account and then investment account -> vacation. Figure out how much salary -> vacation instead. Yes inevstment account will be "income", but that's just the profit in that account over the years. Figure it fucking out
- remove the "merchant's share" and "spending exceeded", "includes money moved" and other inane information
- remove "how to read"
- onhover parent category briefly flashes lighter color than the sankey itself
- onhover switching between mechants or categories I see flashing in the backgrounded sankey arms even if they didn't actually change; stop making slop code, there should be NO flash of content if the content didn't fucking change

Spending by Category - Bars has these issues:
- I used to like the colors shown here, now they are too dark
- you stack the bars one after another, don't make them show with gaps in between, don't worry about vertical scrollbar
- onhover is useless here
- other (merged, under) should have the same pattern as in the sankey
