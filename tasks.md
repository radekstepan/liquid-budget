# Tasks

How to work through the task list below. Follow the steps in order, every run.

## 1. Read the preamble

Before touching any task, read all of this for context:

- `AGENTS.md` — commands, code map, conventions, gotchas (source of truth for workflow).
- `README.md` — product context.
- `.planning/codebase/*.md` — architecture, conventions, testing, integrations.
- `git status` / `git log --oneline -5` — current state and recent work.

Do not skip this even if you have read it before — it may have changed (see step 5).

## 2. Work through tasks in series with subagents

- Take tasks from the list below **in order, one at a time**. Finish a task fully before starting the next.
- Run each task in a **fresh subagent** with the task text plus the preamble files above as context.
- A task is done only when its acceptance criteria hold **and** step 3 passes.
- If a task is blocked, stop the series, note the blocker on the task, and report back. Do not skip ahead.

## 3. Tests must pass

After each task, before committing:

- `yarn test` — full suite must pass.
- `yarn typecheck` — must pass.
- `yarn e2e` — required if the task touched `apps/web`, `packages/ui`, or e2e specs (always via root `yarn e2e` so the port is cleaned; see `AGENTS.md` gotchas).

Never move to the next task with red tests. Fix the code, not the test — unless the test itself is wrong, in which case say so explicitly.

## 4. Commit each task with a changeset

One commit per task, pairing the code with a changeset file that carries the story details:

1. Add `.changeset/<task-id>-<short-slug>.md`:

   ```md
   ---
   "@ynab/web": patch
   "@ynab/logic": patch
   ---

   ## <Task title> (<task-id>)

   <Story: what changed from the user's perspective and why.>
   <Notes: behavior changes, migration steps, follow-ups.>
   ```

   List only the workspaces actually changed; use `minor` for new features, `patch` otherwise.

2. Commit code + changeset together: `git commit -am "<task-id>: <title>"`.
3. Never commit `budget.db*`, `*.y4backup`, `import.csv`, or `snapshots/*.json` (see `yarn check:artifacts`).

## 5. Write major learnings back to markdown

If a task taught you something durable (a gotcha, a convention, an architectural fact, a corrected assumption), update the docs in the same commit:

- Repo workflow / commands / gotchas → `AGENTS.md`.
- Architecture / conventions / testing / integrations → the matching `.planning/codebase/*.md`.
- User-visible behavior → `README.md`.

Small, task-local details stay in the changeset, not the docs.

## Task list (in order)

Spending by Category - Sankey
- Were transfers complete ignored/removed? I want spending to "flow through" these categories if for example we kept depositing into Wealthsimple Trade, then withdrew from there to put down a downpayment on a house. I don't see this. We may have deposited in Questrade, then Wealthsimple Trade. Identify essentially where the money ended up in and where was the source. In this case you might say SAP Concur put money to Questrade then Wealthismple Trade and eventually downpayment. So you say SAP Concur - Downpayment (or whatere) the category is. BUT, the accounts themselves also appreciated money. If that is the case, then you need to say that say Questrade -> Downpayment. Do you get what I am after? I don't want you both showing me I kept depositing hundreds of thousands into Wealthismple Trade and then that Wealthsimple Trade was a source (income) for purchases. I want you to flow the money through. But also identify if we still have any account (we DO!) that we still have money in them. I still have RRSP, TFSA etc. Show it. And that some of the money was used on purchases. That is missing now.
